####### BUILDSLAVES

# The 'slaves' list defines the set of recognized buildslaves. Each element is
# a BuildSlave object, specifying a unique slave name and password.  The same
# slave name and password must be configured on the slave.

# 'protocols' contains information about protocols which master will use for
# communicating with slaves.

# with this protocol.
# 'port' must match the value configured into the buildslaves (with their
# --master option)

####### STATUS TARGETS

# the 'buildbotURL' string should point to the location where the buildbot's
# internal web server (usually the html.WebStatus page) is visible. This
# typically uses the port number set in the Waterfall 'status' entry, but
# with an externally-visible host name which the buildbot cannot figure out
# without some help.
